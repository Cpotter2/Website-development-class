        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<p>Although this pizza isn't homemade, the ingredients are definitely customized. These ingredients are standard at pizza places like <i>Dominos</i>, <i>Pizza Hut</i>, and <i>Papa John's</i>.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Fluffy, Rising Crust - <small>The best kind of crust there is!</small></li>
			<li>Extra Cheese - <small>A necessary addition (when would extra cheese ever be a bad idea?)</small></li>
			<li>Tomato Sauce - <small>Just the standard.</small></li>
			<li>Pepperoni - <small>Something about pepperoni on pizza never fails to disappoint. You always need some kind of meat on a pizza.</small></li>
			<li>Spinach - <small>Get some green on your pizza! This will round out the flavor.</small></li>
			<li>Jalapenos - <small>The kicker! Spicyness will really bring your pizza to another level.</small></li>

        <h2>Background</h2>
		<p>Pizza has always been my favorite food. There's something about it (cheese? sauce? bread?) that always hits the spot for me. However, I've dabbled in the past with meat lover's pizzas, four cheese, margherita, and hawaiian. I never could settle on one type. 
		This pizza came to exist during the <time>Fall 2017</time> semester, on a late night that demanded a delicious pie. With my friends, I scrolled through the Dominos topping list and selected three things that seemed to be different but all tasty: <mark>pepperoni, spinach, and jalapenos.</mark> When the pizza came and I took the first bite, it was instant love. I have never looked back - the golden pizza is the way to go!</p>

        <h3>Image Notes</h3>
            <p>Unfortunately, since this pizza is my creation, I don't have any specific pictures. Therefore, I have provided the runner up: meat lover's.</p>
