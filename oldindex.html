	<h1>Colton Potter</h1>
	<p>I am a student at Oberlin College in Oberlin, OH, and I am taking this course at Valencia over the summer to help out with credit requirements. At Oberlin, I will be getting degrees in <strong> Music Performance </strong> and <strong>Computer Science</strong>. I just graduated from high school in Orlando in 2017. I have two dogs, named Cupcake and Ragamuffin, and I love to spend time with them outside.</p>
	<p>I also enjoy playing video games with my friends - now that it is summer, I look forward to games like <em>League of Legends</em> and <em>Overwatch</em>. Playing basketball is another one of my hobbies, but in the summer, it sure makes you sweat! It seems I will never be able to adapt to the Orlando humidity levels.</p>
